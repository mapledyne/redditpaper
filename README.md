A simple python script to get wallpapers and auto-download them into a folder. Paired with a cronjob with tmpwatch to remove older images, I get a nice rotating collection of images.

Note: This tracks images it already downloaded, so if one shows up in the directory you don't like, just delete it - it won't be re-downloaded.
